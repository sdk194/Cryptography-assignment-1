# Cryptography Assignment 1

This assignment from college tasked us to create an AES encryption in CBC mode with no padding. We were given all the keys that we needed from the lecturer and we were asked to
generate our own keys and use them hence why they are hard-coded into the program.

Another detail in the assignment is that we had to create our own modpow function rather than use the built in method from the biginteger class.
